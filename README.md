# Machine-translation-with-attention-model

This is a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2003") into machine-readable dates ("2003-06-25").
It is using one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models - attention model. 


I would like to emphasize that this model could be used to translate from one language to another, such as translating from English to French,
However, language translation requires massive datasets and it would take days of training on GPUs. In order to make an experiment with these models without using massive datasets, 
i did use it for a simpler "date translation" task.

You can test the trained model and use the model code structure to train on different dataset
